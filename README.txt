Very brief summary:

2022 and 2023 are the two hugo websites (one for each year).  To
build these and upload them to the github hosted website, you need
to check out the actual website repository which is located
at https://github.com/hotcarbon/hotcarbon.github.io

Let's assume you checked that repo out into a directory called ~/hotcarbon-web

To build 2022, go into that subdirectory and type:

$ hugo -d ~/hotcarbon-web/2022

To build 2023, go into that subdirectory and type:

$ hugo -d ~/hotcarbon-web/2023

Inside the hotcarbon-web directory and repo there is a file called
CNAME that's necessary to manage the mapping from hotcarbon.org
to hotcarbon.github.io
